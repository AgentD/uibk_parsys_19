Exercises should be tracked on some **git repository** (UIBK, GitHub, etc.), and **access to that repo should be provided to Philipp**. The exercises need to be completed and pushed before the proseminar starts.

Exercises should be completed in **teams of 2-3 students**.
**Grades** are based on the regular presentations of solutions, and **Q&A during these presentations**.
