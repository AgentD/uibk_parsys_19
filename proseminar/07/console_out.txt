Usage: particle [OPTIONS...]

Runs a simple 2D particle simulation.

WARNING: This craps a lot of data into the current working directory!

Possible options:

  --field-width, -x <number>   The width of the field in which to spawn
                               particles.
  --field-height, -y <number>  The height of the field in which to spawn
                               particles.
  --count, -c <number>         How many particles to spawn.
  --min-mass, -m <number>      Lower threshold for randomized
                               particle mass.
  --max-mass, -M <number>      Uppser threshold for randomized
                               particle mass.
  --steps, -s <number>         How many simulation steps to compute.
  --time, -t <number>          Time difference for each step.

  --help, -h                   Display this help text and exit.
  --version, -V                Display version information and exit.
